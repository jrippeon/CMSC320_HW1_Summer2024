I'm interested in taking 320 because I'm super interested in statistics and applied mathematics.
My main focus is on applications of applied math to engineering (like control theory),
but basic data science is another area that will definitely be useful in the future.

Not to mention it's a prerequisite for every machine learning course :P.
